![R Tools for Visual Studio](/assets/images/2016/03/IC815067.png){: .align-left} If you agree with me that Visual Studio is the best IDE for writing software  you've probably missed the R language in that excellent environment. Well, after some time as a private preview, [Microsoft has announced](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2016/03/09/announcing-r-tools-for-visual-studio-2/) the availability of R Tools for Visual Studio as a public and free preview. As it did previously with [Python Tools](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/python-vs.aspx), [R Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/rtvs-vs.aspx) (RTVS) adds R language development capabilities to the popular IDE.

The main features you will find in this preview release are:

- [Editor](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/editing.html) with a complete editing experience for R scripts and functions.
- [IntelliSense](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/intellisense.html) that introduces auto completion in both the editor and the R Interactive Window.
- [R Interactive Window](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/interactive-repl.html) to work with the R console directly from within Visual Studio.
- [History window](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/history.html) that shows all of the commands that you have typed into the R Interactive Window and send them to the Interactive window.
- [Variable Explorer](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/variable-explorer.html) provides a list of all variables at global scope and allows you to drill into the data.
- [Plotting](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/plotting.html) to see all of the R plots in a Visual Studio tool window.
- [Debugging](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/debugging.html) with breakpoints, stepping, watch windows, call stacks and more.
- [R Markdown](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/rmarkdown.html) support with export to Word and HTML.
- [Git](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/git.html), you can use several source code control systems with RTVS and Git and GitHub are some of them but, for now, you'll need to install a plug-in that provides this support.
- [Extensions](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/extensions.html) through a large library with over 6,000 Extensions as part of the Visual Studio community.
- [Multi language](http://microsoft.github.io/RTVS-docs/polyglot.html) support of R, Python, C++, C#, Node.js and others simultaneously.

RTVS's product manager John Lam presents the following tour around the features:

This preview release is just the beginning. Microsoft has plenty of plans to extend RTVS further.

If you've never tried it and after reading this post I managed to motivate you, start by [downloading Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs?sku=community&clcid=0x409) for free.
