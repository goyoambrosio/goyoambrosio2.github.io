![Lecture recording](/assets/images/2016/05/lecture-recording-320x122.jpg){: .align-left} As many of you know, [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org/) is an educational technology company that offers massive open online courses (MOOCs). Coursera works with [universities and other organizations](https://www.coursera.org/about/partners) to make some of their courses available online, offering courses in very different subjects.

After taking several courses, I have been curious about the technologies Coursera uses in its platform. After surfing the Internet I've discovered some info related to the Coursera´s stack and about the recording of lectures.

## The Coursera's stack

I'm not sure if this information is very up to date, but I've read from some sources that Coursera's platform uses a mix of [PHP](http://www.php.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) running on [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).  The front-end website is built entirely on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), with backend services provided by accessing an API layer written mostly in Python/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and backed by MySQL. There are also other back end services running in a variety of different languages. On the other hand they are moving away from the legacy PHP stack into [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) for better modularization and scalability. You might also be interested in this article [Why we love Scala at Coursera](http://tech.coursera.org/blog/2014/02/18/why-we-love-scala-at-coursera/) written by Brennan Saeta, infrastructure engineer at Coursera.

In addition, Coursera's platform utilizes [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) services quite heavily, using S3, EC2, SES, SQS, CloudSearch, CloudFront and RDS, among others.

## Capturing lectures

![Camtasia Studio 8](/assets/images/2016/05/Camtasia-Studio8.jpg){: .align-left} recommends [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) for Windows but [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) for Macs. Both are **software for screencasting and video editing** that lets you record a video of what’s on your computer screen in addition to your cam.  In post production, you can turn recordings into compelling videos with video editing tools, animations, and effects.

![Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920](/assets/images/2016/05/hd-webcam-pro-c920-gallery.png){: .align-right} To give a touch of humanity, when we record a lecture, often we tend to insert images of oneself (more often if you're handsome or beautiful :). This is the time to choose a **good camera** that can be a digital video camera, or perhaps a high quality webcam as [Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/hd-pro-webcam-c920) with a tripod for out of screen capturing. Regarding lightning, we want soft light on our face, with no strong shadows on ourselves or in the background. For that, we can use a big window in combination with a winter day or some kind of diffuse lights on our desk.

![](/assets/images/2016/05/bluesnowflake.png){: .align-left} When a viewer displays a lecture, perhaps the most important thing is the **quality of voice**. Coursera recommends the [Blue Snowflake microphone](http://www.bluemic.com/products/snowflake/) that has the best value for money. If you want to record a podcast with two or more people, you can also consider the [Blue Snowball](http://www.bluemic.com/products/snowball/) or [Yeti](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/) **microphones**. If background noise is a problem, you'll must use instead a clip on lavalier microphone since these are less sensitive to background noise. A good example is the [Audio-Technica ATR3350 Omnidirectional Condenser Lavalier](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/9c6eca17168eef6f/index.html) microphone.

![](/assets/images/2016/05/wacom.jpg){: .align-right} Perhaps the most problematic point is the **slide annotation**. Coursera recommends using the [Wacom Cintiq 13](http://www.wacom.com/en-hk/products/pen-displays/cintiq-13-hd) tablet, with which you can write with a stylus directly on your slides as viewed in the tablet's monitor screen. A new alternative is the [Microsoft Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-pro-4) that is what I personally use. Usually you will run a PowerPoint in presentation mode so you'll have access to the various highlighters and pens built-in.

Finally, we can't forget the staging. So we must take care of the background and what to wear. For background, we must achieve a **neutral background**. If you have a good optics and some skills you can achieve an out of focus background but an office background is also a good starting point. Regarding costumes, a **casual and comfortable look** is the best and your appearance should be fairly consistent across the term.
