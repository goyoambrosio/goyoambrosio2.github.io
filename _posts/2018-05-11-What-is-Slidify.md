[Slidify](http://slidify.org/) helps create, customize and share, elegant,
dynamic and interactive [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) slides.

You can view slidify presentations with any web browser and share them easily on
[Github](https://github.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or your own
website.

There are many different ways to make R presentations and one of them is
Slidify.

R presentations are presentations coded as Rmarkdown and then translated to HTML
using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) framework.

[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) based R syntax that helps
make documents in many different formats.

[Slidify exist](https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify) as an [R
package](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-packages-guide) by
[Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify) with a huge online
community and popularity. This package has the most options and flexibility and
is clearly aimed at the intermediate to advanced R community. It is an
almagamation of other technologies including [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/),
markdown, and several [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) libraries. It
allows embedded code chunks and mathematical formulas.

Slidify uses [whisker](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker) to render the final
html by passing the parsed data to the layout file. Whisker is a
[Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) implementation in R confirming to the
Mustache specification. Mustache is a logicless templating language, meaning
that no programming source code can be used in your templates.

There are tons of tutorials on slidify. In my case, I focused on the
installation process as well as providing information and examples that helps
reduce common mistakes that are made during your initial learning. As best
example to learn I have written [a Slidify tutorial that you can download and
modify](http://goyoambrosio.com/SlidifyTutorial/).

Enjoy it.
