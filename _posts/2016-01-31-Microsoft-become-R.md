![Microsoft R Open](/assets/images/2016/01/MRO-Logo-1.png){: .align-left}[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) has
entered in a new era that some of us have been waiting for years. Now Microsoft
is more open and the proof is their approach
to [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). As a software
company Microsoft has
added [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) to its catalog
of programming languages.

R is the world’s most powerful programming language for statistical computing,
machine learning and graphics. R is an easy language to learn, and a very
natural and expressive one for data analysis.

R was first implemented in the early 1990’s by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka,
both faculty members at the University of Auckland. Robert and Ross established
R as an open source project in 1995. Since 1997,
the [R project](https://www.r-project.org/) has been managed by the R Core
Group. And in February 2000, R 1.0.0 was released.

The R language was closely modeled on
the[ S Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) for
Statistical Computing conceived by John Chambers, Rick Becker, Trevor Hastie,
Allan Wilks and others at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s, and made publicly
available in the early 1980’s.

The current version of Open R is the result of years of collaboration from
people all over the globe. R was initially written by Robert Gentleman and Ross
Ihaka, who were known as "R & R" of the Statistics Department of the University
of Auckland.

At the center of the R Open Source Project and R Community is R Core, a group of
approximately twenty developers who maintain R and guide its evolution. The
official public structure for the R Community is provided by the R Foundation, a
not for profit organization with an impressive list of members and supporters.
The[ R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) ensures the financial
stability of the R-project and holds and administers the copyright of R software
and its documentation.

[Microsoft R Open (MRO](https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/)), formerly known
as Revolution R Open (RRO), is the enhanced distribution of R from Microsoft
Corporation. It is a complete open source platform for statistical analysis and
data science.

The current version, MRO 3.2.3, is based on (and 100% compatible
with) [R-3.2.3](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/), the most widely used
statistics software in the world, and is therefore fully compatibility with all
packages, scripts and applications that work with that version of R. It includes
additional capabilities for improved performance, reproducibility, as well as
Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux based platform support. Like R, Microsoft R Open is
open source and free to download, use, and share.

MRO 3.2.3 was built on R-3.2.3 from the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
R is the most widely-used language for statistics and data science, and is
ranked
the
[9th most popular](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/07/ieee-ranks-r-9-amongst-all-languages.html) of
all data science languages by the IEEE. R is used by leading companies around
the world as part of data-driven applications in industries including finance,
healthcare, technology, scientific research, media, government and academia. The
R language includes every data type, data manipulation, statistical model, and
chart that the modern data scientist could ever need.

There are a lot of R related resources in the cyberspace but you can begin to
